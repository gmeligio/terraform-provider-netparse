# netparse_url (Data Source)

Parses URL components from a URL string. It uses the [net/url](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url) go package to parse the URL. For more details on the URL components, see [What is a URL?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL) and [WHATWG URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#api).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get the host from the URL
data "netparse_url" "example" {
  url = "https://abc:def@example.com:45/path/to/somewhere?foo=bar&baz=qux#231"
}

output "url" {
  value = data.netparse_url.example

  # {
  #   url         = "https://abc:def@example.com:45/path/to/somewhere?foo=bar&baz=qux#231"
  #   authority   = "abc:def@example.com:45"
  #   credentials = "abc:def"
  #   fragment    = "231"
  #   hash        = "#231"
  #   host        = "example.com"
  #   password    = "def"
  #   path        = "/path/to/somewhere"
  #   port        = 45
  #   protocol    = "https:"
  #   query       = "foo=bar&baz=qux"
  #   scheme      = "https"
  #   search      = "?foo=bar&baz=qux"
  #   username    = "abc"
  # }
}

# Then get the domain from the host
data "netparse_domain" "example" {
  host = data.netparse_url.example.host
}

output "domain" {
  value = data.netparse_domain.example

  # {
  #   host = "example.com"
  #   domain = "example.com"
  #   manager = "ICANN"
  #   sld = "example"
  #   subdomain = ""
  #   tld = "com"
  # }
}
```
